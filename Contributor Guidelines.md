# Contributor Guidelines

Contribution of time and effort to this repo is greatly appreciated. To assist you, the following guidelines have been put in place to ensure everyone is working to a common standard.

## Code of Conduct

Please ensure you familiarise yourself with our code of conduct: Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

In short, be excellent to each other.

## Style Guidelines

Code style guidelines help to ensure consistent formatting and readability. Pull requests that do not conform to our coding practices may still be accepted if they are re-formatted however it is important to
Please do not submit a PR which simply changes the formatting of our existing code.

To help you write code which adheres to our guidelines, note the following:

*	**Visual Studio Code** is used as the IDE of choice - https://code.visualstudio.com/
*	The Microsoft PowerShell extension should be used, search for **ms-vscode.powershell** in the extension marketplace
    * We recommend to use the current production release only and avoid using insider/beta versions when contributing code
*	When submitting code for review please ensure you use the **Format Document** option in Visual Studio Code

Please ensure your VS Code installation is using defaults regarding spacing/indentation etc. You are free to write code in a way that works for you, but you must make sure finalised code for submission is automatically formatted through the **Format Document** option. 

This will ensure consistency with our current code base and across contributors.

## Issues

Issues such as bug reports should be submitted using the template provided. This ensures the baseline information we require to support you is captured on initial creation and avoids us having to ask for the same information each time somebody generates an issue. The same principal applies when submitting a Feature Request, please use the template provided.

Additional information above and beyond the template minimum is welcome.

If you wish to show your enthusiasm for a feature request or identify that you too suffer from a reported bug, please use the thumbs up :thumbsup: option. Comments should be reserved for useful discourse to avoid threads being filled with responses that do not move the issue forward.

## Pull Requests (PR)

When submitting a PR please complete the templated information - failure to complete this information may result in your PR being rejected.

## Documentation and Help

It is important to include appropriate documentation and help when submitting a PR. Simple changes may be self-documenting and require minimal explanation. More complex change without appropriate documentation may result in your PR being rejected.

Comments and help within your code should be included where new features or changes are being implemented. When submitting a PR for a bug fix there may already be inline comments/help - if this is the case you should review and ensure your change does not invalidate the existing help.

A review of the existing code will help your understand where and how help comments and console feedback are used. You should try to emulate this style to avoid issues with your PR.

## Misc

If you're still unsure with regard to any aspect of contributing, then please get in touch so we can improve the documentation and process.
Collaboration drives innovation and progress and we do not want ineffective documentation to get in the way of that ðŸ˜Š
